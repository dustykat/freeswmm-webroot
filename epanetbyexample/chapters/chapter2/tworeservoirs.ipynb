    "# Flow Between Two Reservoirs\n",
    "\n",
    "This example represents the situation where the total head is known at two points on a pipeline, and one wishes to determine the flow rate (or specify a flow rate and solve for a pipe diameter).   Like the prior example it is contrived, but follows the same general modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using the Moody chart, and the energy equation, estimate the diameter of a cast-iron pipe needed to carry 60$^o$F water at a discharge of 10 cubic-feet per second (cfs) between two reservoirs 2 miles apart.  The elevation difference between the water surfaces in the two reservoirs is 20 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the prior example, we will need to specify the pipe roughness terms, then solve by trial-and-error for the diameter required to carry the water at the desired flowrate.  Page 31 of the EPANET manual suggests that the roughness height for cast iron is 0.85 millifeet.\n",
